## Executive Summary

The study entitled **"Recomee: A Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm-Enabled Application for Optimizing Career Selection with Smart Recommendations for President Ramon Magsaysay State University"** addresses the modern challenges faced by graduating students in selecting suitable career paths.
The study's methodology for developing a career recommendation application involved several key steps. Graduate tracer data from PRMSU (2016-2020) was collected and supplemented with Kaggle data. This data was cleaned, transformed, and integrated into a unified dataset. Feature engineering refined the dataset by removing irrelevant information and encoding categorical variables. The **Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm** was chosen for model building, with the data split into training, validation, and test sets. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix. For acceptability assessment, program chairpersons and 180 graduating students participated, with surveys administered to chairpersons and questionnaires distributed to students via Google Forms.
Key objectives of the study include selecting an appropriate supervised learning framework, assembling and refining a comprehensive dataset, implementing the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm for smart recommendations, developing a user-friendly application capable of real-time predictions, and evaluate the level of acceptability in terms of functional suitability and performance efficiency of the developed application.

1. Determining the best framework for this purpose, **Na√Øve Bayes** was chosen for its simplicity, effectiveness with labeled data, and suitability for high-dimensional datasets.
2. Pre-processing was done to address data inconsistencies from the initial dataset, PRMSU Graduate Tracer Data from 2016-2020. Supplementary Kaggle data improved the dataset, resulting in a final dataset of 1533 rows and 5 columns, with accuracy metrics of **95.89% for the training set and 88.15% for the test set.**
3. The Na√Øve Bayes algorithm was applied to develop a career recommendation application. The model showed high performance with an Accuracy of **95.89% (training set) and 88.15% (test set), and achieved Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores of 85.38%, 88.15%, and 86.27%, respectively**, demonstrating its effectiveness in career recommendations.
4. The developed web application Recomee, offers personalized career recommendations based on users' profiles by leveraging tools like **Python (Django), NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Joblib and Pandas** ensuring a robust approach for career recommendation and analysis.
5. In terms of Recomee's level of acceptability, graduating students rated its functional suitability as **"Highly Acceptable"** with a weighted mean of 3.85, while program chairpersons rated it slightly lower at 3.50. Performance efficiency was also rated **"Highly Acceptable,"** with students giving a mean of 3.42 and chairpersons 3.32. Both groups appreciated the application's minimal errors and effective predictive analytics.

In summary, Recomee represents a significant advancement in leveraging technology to address critical challenges in career guidance, marking a milestone for future applications in the field. Continued refinement and integration of user feedback ensure its ongoing relevance and effectiveness in assisting graduating students throughout their career selection journey.
